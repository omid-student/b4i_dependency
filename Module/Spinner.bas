'++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
'Class-Name	:	Spinner (for iOS)
'Version	:	0.20
'Author		:	Hugh Thomas
'
' Revision History
' 0.9   Initial release
' 0.10  Fix problem in spr.AddAll(). Was saving a reference to the passed list, not making a copy. 
'		Enabled flag not enforced correctly.
' 0.11  Fix itemList not initialised bug
' 0.20	1) Can now be added as a CustomView in the Designer
' 		2) Added spr.GetBase. If the Spinner was created in the Designer then spr.GetBase returns the Base Panel
'		   provided by the Designer. If the Spinner was created programmatically then spr.GetBase returns
' 		   the internal Spinner label. Note that spr.View always returns the internal Spinner Label.
'		3) Added spr.RemoveViewFromParent. Does the same things as spr.RemoveView. 
'		4) Fixed bug in IsInitialized()
'++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
'Class module

' This class emulates the programmatic interface of the B4A Spinner. Internally it is implemented as 
' a label, which when clicked displays an Action Sheet for the user to make their selection.
' This view can be created in the Designer or programmatically. If created in the Designer then the 
' internal lblSpinner Label will be added within the Base Panel provided by the Designer.

' All of the methods in the B4A Spinner are implemented EXCEPT the following
'   Background     
'   DropdownBackgroundColor 
'   DropdownTextColor       
'   Invalidate    
'   Invalidate2   
'   Invalidate3   
'   Prompt
'   SetBackgroundImage
'   SetColorAnimated  
'   SetVisibleAnimated
'
' In addition, the following methods have been added:
' 	GetBase
' 	RemoveViewFromParent (same as RemoveView)
'   SetBorder
'   SetCallbackModule
'   View
'   TextAlignment attribute
